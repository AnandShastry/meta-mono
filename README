1) Intro

meta-mono is an OpenEmbedded layer that builds mono runtime and mono
libraries to allow users to run .NET applications under linux built
using OE. For more info about mono, see mono project's website. For
more info on OpenEmbedded, see OE's website.

This README pertains to meta-mono layer support for Mono 3.2.8 

For Mono release notes please see:

http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_3.2

NOTE: That as of Mono 3.2.7 there is initial support for the ARM hardfp ABI
      which should enable us to use hardfp builds of e.g. Yocto/Poky

2) Dependencies

On the host:
The host system must have the following packges:
gcc g++ patch diffstat texi2html texinfo cvs subversion gawk
chrpath make libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libsdl1.2-dev
git libxml-parser-perl bison gettext flex unzip rpm2cpio

On the target:
So far, Windows Forms applications have been tested under Sato.
Mono does not require Sato, it does require X if you want to run
Windows Forms applications. While mono can run w/o X, that recipe
is not supported currently. It is unlikely to be supported.

5) Current State - x86: Works

25/02/2014

Alex J Lennon (ajlennon@dynamicdevices.co.uk) has tested a Poky 
build on a qemux86 platform, with a simple console application 
and a simple Windows Forms application. 

6) Current State - ARM vfp: Works

25/02/2014

Alex J Lennon (ajlennon@dynamicdevices.co.uk) has tested a Poky 
build on a Freescale i.MX6 platform, with a simple console application 
and a simple Windows Forms application. 

7) Current State - ARM hardfp: Builds

Builds for i.MX6 platform with hardfp enabled. Needs testing.

7) Current State - MIPS: Unknown

More investigation is needed, if there is an interest in getting
mono to work perfectly on MIPS, please contact the maintainer.

8) Current State - PPC

More investigation is needed, if there is an interest in getting
mono to work perfectly on PPC, please contact the maintainer.

9) Current State - alpha, amd64, hppa, ia64, s390 & sparc: Unknown

When qemu provided by Yocto supports one of these machines, the
maintainer will support these architectures.

10) TODO

10.1) see if mono works for amd64, seems like qemux86-64 is available
10.2) investigate why windows forms apps dont run on MIPS
10.2) investigate why compilation fails for PPC
10.3) run mono runtime tests for ARM
10.4) run mono runtime tests for MIPS
10.5) run mono runtime tests for PPC
10.6) run mono library tests for ARM
10.7) run mono library tests for MIPS
10.8) run mono library tests for PPC
10.9) write recipes to create packages for runtime tests
10.10) write recipes to create packages for mscorlib library tests
10.11) write recipes to create packages for System.dll library tests
10.12) try mono on beagleboard (email maintainer when you do this, he will thank you)
10.13) write a recipe for windows forms app
